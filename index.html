            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">It would be interesting to see energy trends by location, time and source, and understand the environmental implications on the respective area grids (emissions, EPA restrictions, recycling efforts, etc), especially in the "Outlook" sets.</p>

            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">This data set could be very informative with respect to teaching users/viewers about American commerce with respect to commodities, especially considering location and movement to point of use/consumption. From an economics perspective, this data set could provide a good basis for exploratory data visualizations and create a learning tool for understanding commerce and economy.</p>

            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">Spending behaviors and cost allocations would be insightful information to understand how Americans spending their money, what their priorities are, and possibly see if location has an effect on this. It's also interesting to see just how much information is available in this data set with respect to people's perception of their privacy.</p>

            <p class="mbot_2">The core of the dataset is the feature analysis and metadata for 
one million songs, provided by The Echo Nest. The dataset does not include any 
audio, only the derived features.</p>
            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">From an exploratory perspective, this dataset might provide some interesting insights on patterns or similarities in music and lyrics. Music is something that interests many people, and features like iTunes Genius tends to fascinate users with it's ability to find "similar songs" that sound nothing like the original. This is a potentially exciting prospect: exploratory data visualizations in music.</p>

            <p class="mbot_2">Genetics has become a hot topic for exploration in recent years in response to scientific advancement and reduction in cost of analysis. This could be a very rich data set in exploring Human Genetics in almost any aspect, such as trait-to-ethnicity mappings, regional differences, percent-of-population traits, and any trends therein.The Human Genome is not only interesting to scientists, but also the general public, as it information regarding genetics gives us insightful understanding of our history and evolution.</p>

        <p><h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3> 
            <p class="mbot_2">The 2010 School Survey on Crime and Safety is a study that is part of the School Survey on Crime and Safety program. It is a cross-sectional survey of the nation's public schools designed to provide estimates of school crime, discipline, disorder, programs and policies. SSOCS is administered to public primary, middle, high, and combined school principals in the spring of even numbered school years. The study was conducted using a questionnaire and telephone follow-ups of school principals. Public schools were sampled in the spring of 2010 to participate in the study. The study's response rate was 74.3 percent. A number of key statistics on a variety of topics can be produced with SSOCS data.
</p>
            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">School crime and safety are becoming important topics with regard to study environments. Many schools have set up their own departments for criminal control to ensure the safety of students and faculties. Such data will be paid more attention with primary and middle schools because those students are younger and their parents concerned so much on whether their children will be safe during school time. Moreover, when investigative results are presented, students, parents and teachers must hope that the safety systems will not only appear within the school area, but also appear in greater ranges. And, the national security system needs to think much of this.

        <p><h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3> 
            <p class="mbot_2">"Children of immigrants" or "children with immigrant parents" are children who have at least one foreign-born parent living in the household. Children with native-born parents live with two parents that are both native-born or a single parent who is native-born. "Immigrant" or "foreign-born" persons are born outside the United States and its territories. Those born in Puerto Rico and other territories or born abroad to U.S. citizen parents are "native-born." The number of children with immigrant parents is estimated for the smallest level of geography available in the microdata, the Primary Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). In order to derive metro level statistics, the Urban Institute employed the Missouri Census Data Center's MABLE/Geocorr2K online application to crosswalk the 2000 PUMAs to the U.S. Census Bureau November 2008 Core Based Statistical Area definitions.
</p>
            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">Many foreigners chose to immigrate and let their children born in developed countries in order to ensure their children to live in better living conditions and study under better educational resources. The research is very interesting because we can see how many foreigners use their current conditions to make their children to immigrate. If the crowd is growing continuously and becoming huge, whether the government would take some measures to control OR still indifferent?

            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">Many foreigners look forward to seeking a job in US, which depends on the enhancement of employment status in local area. Whether the rate holds up well, which is also regarded as an important aspect to affect the employment. Lots of international students eager to obtain a satisfied job after their graduations, which also lies on local employment situations. It stands no chance that foreigners can get a job if local residents could not find a job. Therefore, not only indigenous people concern the results of the data, foreigners and international students also interested in the data. </p>

            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">International trade has flourished over the years due to the many benefits it has offered to different countries across the globe. International trade is the exchange of services, goods, and capital among various countries and regions, without much hindrance. The international trade accounts for a good part of a country's gross domestic product. It is also one of important sources of revenue for a developing country.

        <p><h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3> 
            <p class="mbot_2">Food environment factors--such as store/restaurant proximity, food prices, food and nutrition assistance programs, and community characteristics--interact to influence food choices and diet quality. Research is beginning to document the complexity of these interactions, but more is needed to identify causal relationships and effective policy interventions. The objectives of the Atlas are to assemble statistics on food environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food choices and diet quality, and to provide a spatial overview of a community's ability to access healthy food and its success in doing so.
</p>
            <h3>WHY: </h3>
            <p class="mbot_2">Food is essential to life. It also forms an important part of our cultural identity, and plays an important role in the economy. People are aware that the food they eat is an important factor affecting their health, but what is less well known is the impact producing and consuming food has on the world's resources.
