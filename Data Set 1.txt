ENERGY

         http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Coal_power_plant_Datteln_2_Crop1.png (energy_2)
DESCRIPTION: This data set shows many different aspects of energy usage and consumption by source:
electricity in different categories
State Energy Data System in categories
Petroleum
Natural Gas
Coal
Short-Term Energy Outlook
Annual Energy Outlook
WHY: It would be interesting to see energy trends by location, time and source, 
and understand the environmental implications on the respective area grids (emissions, EPA restrictions, 
recycling efforts, etc), especially in the "Outlook" sets.

DESCRIPTION: This data set shows information on the buying habits of American consumers, 
including data on their expenditures, income, and consumer unit (families and single consumers) characteristics. 
The survey data are collected for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The CE collects information on all spending components including food, housing, apparel and services, 
transportation, entertainment, and out-of-pocket health care costs including insurance premiums.
WHY: Spending behaviors and cost allocations would be insightful information to understand how Americans
spending their money, what their priorities are, and possibly see if location has an effect on this. It's
also interesting to see just how much information is available in this data set with respect to people's 
perception of their privacy.

COMMODITY FLOW

DESCRIPTION: This database produces data on the movement of goods in the United States. It provides information on commodities shipped, their value, weight, and mode of transportation, as well as the origin and destination of shipments of commodities from manufacturing, mining, wholesale, and selected retail and services establishments.
WHY: This data set could be very informative with respect to teaching users/viewers about American commerce with respect to commodities, especially considering location and movement to point of use/consumption. From an economics perspective, this data set could provide a good basis for exploratory data visualizations and create a learning tool for understanding commerce and economy.

MUSIC

DESCRIPTION: The core of the dataset is the feature analysis and metadata for one million songs, provided by The Echo Nest. The dataset does not include any audio, only the derived features.
WHY: From an exploratory perspective, this dataset might provide some interesting insights on patterns or similarities in music and lyrics. Music is something that interests many people, and features like iTunes Genius tends to fascinate users with it's ability to find "similar songs" that sound nothing like the original. This is a potentially exciting prospect: exploratory data visualizations in music.


GENOMES

DESCRIPTION: The 1000 Genomes Project is an international effort to create a detailed catalog human genetic variation. The plan for the full project is to sequence about 2,500 samples from populations around the world at 4X or better coverage. Although this plan continues to change as better sequencing technologies come online. Recent improvements in sequencing technology ("next-gen" sequencing platforms) have sharply reduced the cost of sequencing. The 1000 Genomes Project is the first project to sequence the genomes of a large number of people, to provide a comprehensive resource on human genetic variation.
WHY: Genetics has become a hot topic for exploration in recent years in response to scientific advancement and reduction in cost of analysis. This could be a very rich data set in exploring Human Genetics in almost any aspect, such as trait-to-ethnicity mappings, regional differences, percent-of-population traits, and any trends therein.The Human Genome is not only interesting to scientists, but also the general public, as it informaiton regarding genetics gives us insightful understanding of our history and evolution.

DESCRIPTION: The 2010 School Survey on Crime and Safety is a study that is part of the School Survey on Crime and Safety program. It is a cross-sectional survey of the nation's public schools designed to provide estimates of school crime, discipline, disorder, programs and policies. SSOCS is administered to public primary, middle, high, and combined school principals in the spring of even numbered school years. The study was conducted using a questionnaire and telephone follow-ups of school principals. Public schools were sampled in the spring of 2010 to participate in the study. The studyâ€™s response rate was 74.3 percent. A number of key statistics on a variety of topics can be produced with SSOCS data.
WHY: School crime and safety are becoming important topics with regard to study environments. Many schools have set up their own departments for criminal control to ensure the safety of students and faculties. Such data will be paid more attention with primary and middle schools because those students are younger and their parents concerned so much on whether their children will be safe during school time. Moreover, when investigative results are presented, students, parents and teachers must hope that the safety systems will not only appear within the school area, but also appear in greater ranges. And, the national security system needs to think much of this. 

CHILDERN OF IMMIGRANTS:

DESCRIPTION:"Children of immigrants" or "children with immigrant parents" are children who have at least one foreign-born parent living in the household. Children with native-born parents live with two parents that are both native-born or a single parent who is native-born. "Immigrant" or "foreign-born" persons are born outside the United States and its territories. Those born in Puerto Rico and other territories or born abroad to U.S. citizen parents are "native-born." The number of children with immigrant parents is estimated for the smallest level of geography available in the microdata, the Primary Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). In order to derive metro level statistics, the Urban Institute employed the Missouri Census Data Center's MABLE/Geocorr2K online application to crosswalk the 2000 PUMAs to the U.S. Census Bureau November 2008 Core Based Statistical Area definitions.
WHY:Many foreigners chose to immigrate and let their children born in developed countries in order to ensure their children to live in better living conditions and study under better educational resources. The research is very interesting because we can see how many foreigners use their current conditions to make their children to immigrate. If the crowd is growing continuously and becoming huge, whether the government would take some measures to control OR still indifferent?
