         http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Coal_power_plant_Datteln_2_Crop1.png (energy_2)
DESCRIPTION: This data set shows many different aspects of energy usage and consumption by source:
electricity in different categories
State Energy Data System in categories
Petroleum
Natural Gas
Coal
Short-Term Energy Outlook
Annual Energy Outlook

WHY: It would be interesting to see energy trends by location, time and source, 
and understand the environmental implications on the respective area grids (emissions, EPA restrictions, 
recycling efforts, etc), especially in the "Outlook" sets.

INCOME vs. SPENDING

         http://q10travelandtours.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Budget-Piggy-Bank.jpg (consumer_2)
DESCRIPTION: This data set shows information on the buying habits of American consumers, 
including data on their expenditures, income, and consumer unit (families and single consumers) characteristics. 
The survey data are collected for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The CE collects information on all spending components including food, housing, apparel and services, 
transportation, entertainment, and out-of-pocket health care costs including insurance premiums.

WHY: Spending behaviors and cost allocations would be insightful information to understand how Americans
spending their money, what their priorities are, and possibly see if location has an effect on this. It's
also interesting to see just how much information is available in this data set with respect to people's 
perception of their privacy.

COMMODITY FLOW

DESCRIPTION: This database produces data on the movement of goods in the United States. 
It provides information on commodities shipped, their value, weight, and mode of transportation, 
as well as the origin and destination of shipments of commodities from manufacturing, mining, wholesale, 
and selected retail and services establishments.

WHY: This data set could be very informative with respect to teaching users/viewers about 
American commerce with respect to commodities, especially considering location and movement 
to point of use/consumption. From an economics perspective, this data set could provide a good 
basis for exploratory data visualizations and create a learning tool for understanding commerce 
and economy.

MUSIC

DESCRIPTION: The core of the dataset is the feature analysis and metadata for 
one million songs, provided by The Echo Nest. The dataset does not include any 
audio, only the derived features.

WHY: From an exploratory perspective, this dataset might provide some interesting 
insights on patterns or similarities in music and lyrics. Music is something that 
interests many people, and features like iTunes Genius tends to fascinate users 
with it's ability to find "similar songs" that sound nothing like the original. 
This is a potentially exciting prospect: exploratory data visualizations in music.


GENOMES

DESCRIPTION: The 1000 Genomes Project is an international effort to create a 
detailed catalog human genetic variation. The plan for the full project is to 
sequence about 2,500 samples from populations around the world at 4X or better coverage. 
Although this plan continues to change as better sequencing technologies come online. 
Recent improvements in sequencing technology ("next-gen" sequencing platforms) have 
sharply reduced the cost of sequencing. The 1000 Genomes Project is the first project 
to sequence the genomes of a large number of people, to provide a comprehensive 
resource on human genetic variation.

WHY: Genetics has become a hot topic for exploration in recent years in response to 
scientific advancement and reduction in cost of analysis. This could be a very rich data 
set in exploring Human Genetics in almost any aspect, such as trait-to-ethnicity mappings, 
regional differences, percent-of-population traits, and any trends therein.The Human Genome 
is not only interesting to scientists, but also the general public, as it information 
regarding genetics gives us insightful understanding of our history and evolution.

DESCRIPTION: The 2010 School Survey on Crime and Safety is a study that is part of the School Survey on Crime and Safety 
program. It is a cross-sectional survey of the nation's public schools designed to provide estimates of school crime, 
discipline, disorder, programs and policies. SSOCS is administered to public primary, middle, high, and combined school 
principals in the spring of even numbered school years. The study was conducted using a questionnaire and telephone 
follow-ups of school principals. Public schools were sampled in the spring of 2010 to participate in the study. 
The study’s response rate was 74.3 percent. A number of key statistics on a variety of topics can be produced 
with SSOCS data.

WHY: School crime and safety are becoming important topics with regard to study environments. Many schools have set up 
their own departments for criminal control to ensure the safety of students and faculties. Such data will be paid more 
attention with primary and middle schools because those students are younger and their parents concerned so much on 
whether their children will be safe during school time. Moreover, when investigative results are presented, students, 
parents and teachers must hope that the safety systems will not only appear within the school area, but also appear in 
greater ranges. And, the national security system needs to think much of this. 









2. CHILDERN OF IMMIGRANTS:

252Fquestion-2699783%252F%3B350%3B222

DESCRIPTION:"Children of immigrants" or "children with immigrant parents" are children who have at least one foreign-born 
parent living in the household. Children with native-born parents live with two parents that are both native-born or a 
single parent who is native-born. "Immigrant" or "foreign-born" persons are born outside the United States and its 
territories. Those born in Puerto Rico and other territories or born abroad to U.S. citizen parents are "native-born." 
The number of children with immigrant parents is estimated for the smallest level of geography available in the microdata, 
the Primary Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). In order to derive metro level statistics, the Urban Institute employed the 
Missouri Census Data Center's MABLE/Geocorr2K online application to crosswalk the 2000 PUMAs to the U.S. Census Bureau 
November 2008 Core Based Statistical Area definitions.

WHY:Many foreigners chose to immigrate and let their children born in developed countries in order to ensure their 
children to live in better living conditions and study under better educational resources. The research is very 
interesting because we can see how many foreigners use their current conditions to make their children to immigrate. 
If the crowd is growing continuously and becoming huge, whether the government would take some measures to control 
OR still indifferent?

Background-Checks%3B350%3B240

DESCRIPTION:Each month the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program surveys about 150,000 businesses and government 
agencies, representing approximately 390,000 individual worksites, in order to provide detailed industry data on employment, 
hours, and earnings of workers on nonfarm payrolls.

WHY:Many foreigners look forward to seeking a job in US, which depends on the enhancement of employment status in local 
area. Whether the rate holds up well, which is also regarded as an important aspect to affect the employment. Lots of 
international students eager to obtain a satisfied job after their graduations, which also lies on local employment 
situations. It stands no chance that foreigners can get a job if local residents could not find a job. Therefore, 
not only indigenous people concern the results of the data, foreigners and international students also interested 
in the data.

DESCRIPTION:Monthly report that provides national trade data including imports, exports, and balance of payments for goods and services. Statistics are also reported on a year-to-date basis. Data are continuously compiled and processed. Documents are collected as shipments arrive and depart, and are processed on a flow basis. The BEA uses the data to update U.S. balance of payments, gross domestic product, and national accounts. 

WHY:International trade has flourished over the years due to the many benefits it has offered to different countries across the globe. International trade is the exchange of services, goods, and capital among various countries and regions, without much hindrance. The international trade accounts for a good part of a country’s gross domestic product. It is also one of important sources of revenue for a developing country.

DESCRIPTION:Food environment factors--such as store/restaurant proximity, food prices, food and nutrition assistance programs, and community characteristics--interact to influence food choices and diet quality. Research is beginning to document the complexity of these interactions, but more is needed to identify causal relationships and effective policy interventions. The objectives of the Atlas are to assemble statistics on food environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food choices and diet quality, and to provide a spatial overview of a community's ability to access healthy food and its success in doing so.

WHY:Food is essential to life. It also forms an important part of our cultural identity, and plays an important role in the economy. People are aware that the food they eat is an important factor affecting their health, but what is less well known is the impact producing and consuming food has on the world's resources.
