DESCRIPTION: This data set shows many different aspects of energy usage and consumption by source:
electricity in different categories
State Energy Data System in categories
Petroleum
Natural Gas
Coal
Short-Term Energy Outlook
Annual Energy Outlook
WHY: It would be interesting to see energy trends by location, time and source, 
and understand the environmental implications on the respective area grids (emissions, EPA restrictions, 
recycling efforts, etc), especially in the "Outlook" sets.

DESCRIPTION: This data set shows information on the buying habits of American consumers, 
including data on their expenditures, income, and consumer unit (families and single consumers) characteristics. 
The survey data are collected for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The CE collects information on all spending components including food, housing, apparel and services, 
transportation, entertainment, and out-of-pocket health care costs including insurance premiums.
WHY: Spending behaviors and cost allocations would be insightful information to understand how Americans
spending their money, what their priorities are, and possibly see if location has an effect on this. It's
also interesting to see just how much information is available in this data set with respect to people's 
perception of their privacy.

It provides information on commodities shipped, their value, weight, and mode of transportation, as well as the origin and destination of shipments of commodities from manufacturing, mining, wholesale, and selected retail and services establishments.
WHY: This data set could be very informative with respect to teaching users/viewers about American commerce with respect to commodities, especially considering location and movement to point of use/consumption. From an economics perspective, this data set could provide a good basis for exploratory data visualizations.
