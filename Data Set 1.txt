electricity in different categories
State Energy Data System in categories
Petroleum

Coal
Short-Term Energy Outlook

WHY: It would be interesting to see energy trends by location, time and source, 
and understand the environmental implications on the respective area grids (emissions, EPA restrictions, 
recycling efforts, etc), especially in the "Outlook" sets.

DESCRIPTION: This data set shows information on the buying habits of American consumers, 
including data on their expenditures, income, and consumer unit (families and single consumers) characteristics. 
The survey data are collected for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The CE collects information on all spending components including food, housing, apparel and services, 
transportation, entertainment, and out-of-pocket health care costs including insurance premiums.
WHY: Spending behaviors and cost allocations would be insightful information to understand how Americans
spending their money, what their priorities are, and possibly see if location has an effect on this. It's
also interesting to see just how much information is available in this data set with respect to people's 
perception of their privacy.
